# colab_utils
Some useful (or not so much) Python stuff for Google Colab notebooks


## How to install it:
Click on a code cell and paste:
```
!pip install git+git://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/colab_utils.git
```
Then `alt+enter` or `shift+enter` to execute. 

## Examples
- [Notebook with examples of each function](Testing_colab_utils.ipynb).
- [Object Detection and Segmentation, kind of real-time, directly from your webcam](object_detection_tutorial_from_webcam.ipynb).

And here is the output while the [segmentation](object_detection_tutorial_from_webcam.ipynb) was running on colab getting images from my webcam (live):

*And before anyone asks, yes, I wear Star Wars pijamas... only during quarantine ;)

## TODO
Improve the code because right now it's a mess, as non-optimal as it gets, but it works and it's cool to do stuff directly using Google Colab ;)
